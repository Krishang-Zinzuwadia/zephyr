# Zephyr Voice Input Configuration
# This is the default configuration file for Zephyr
# Copy this to ~/.config/zephyr/config.yaml and customize as needed

# Hotkey configuration
hotkey: "ctrl+alt_r"  # Key to activate voice input (Ctrl + Right Alt)

# Speech recognition model
# Options: tiny, base, small, medium, large
# Smaller models are faster but less accurate
# Recommended: base (good balance) or small (better accuracy)
model: "base"

# Language configuration
# Use "auto" for automatic detection or specify language code (e.g., "en", "es", "fr")
language: "auto"

# Audio settings
audio:
  sample_rate: 16000  # Hz - optimal for Whisper
  channels: 1  # Mono recording
  chunk_duration: 1.0  # seconds - for streaming transcription

# Typing simulation settings
typing:
  speed: 50  # characters per second
  use_clipboard_fallback: true  # Use clipboard if direct typing fails

# UI overlay settings
ui:
  width: 400  # pixels
  height: 120  # pixels (will expand for longer text)
  border_radius: 16  # pixels
  background_opacity: 0.95  # 0.0 to 1.0
  blur_enabled: true
  animation_speed: 1.0  # multiplier for animation timing (1.0 = normal)
  show_confidence: false  # Show transcription confidence scores

# Advanced settings
advanced:
  min_press_duration: 100  # milliseconds - ignore shorter key presses
  auto_start: true  # Start on system login
  log_level: "INFO"  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  log_file: "~/.local/share/zephyr/logs/zephyr.log"
  
  # Voice Activity Detection
  vad_enabled: true
  vad_threshold: 0.5  # 0.0 to 1.0 - higher = more strict
  
  # Transcription settings
  beam_size: 5  # Whisper beam search size (higher = more accurate but slower)
  best_of: 5  # Number of candidates to consider
  temperature: 0.0  # Sampling temperature (0 = deterministic)
  
  # Resource management
  unload_model_after: 300  # seconds - unload model after idle time (0 = never)
  max_recording_duration: 60  # seconds - maximum recording length
